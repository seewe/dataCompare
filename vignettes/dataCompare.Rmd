# Overview

Data scientists always used data to generate insight. They develope models to explain or predict an output variables with input feature.  
Sometime, they develope pipelines to complete an End to End process. Going from raw data to final prediction or Scoring involve many 
steps :  

  1- Data loading  
  2- Data preprocessing  or transformation  
  3- Model training   
  4- Model prediction  
  5- Post models prediction logic : pridction agregation, indicators calculation and segmentation  
  
Each of these steps generate data called here `Intermediate results` or `Final output`.  

Most of the time, machine learning models are standalone object shared through API with other applications.  
To make sure the deployed API pipeline looks exactly like the modeler's pipeline, we need to compare their outputs.  
Here, **`Data For Know (D4K)`** proposed a graphical way to perform the comparison of the two pipelines.  
**`dataCompare`** is a tool used to compare two machine learning pipelines outputs. It help to check if the pipelines
are similar or not.

# Presentation

dataCompare is a shiny app, develop with the Golem framework. It is used to check values differencies between two dataframe. The code bellow shows how to install it from Github and CRAN.  

## Install and Load


```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
# From Cran
install.packages('dataCompare')

# From Github
install_github('seewe/dataCompare')

# Load in the environment
library(dataCompare)
```


## Run the app with the following code

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataCompare::run_data_compare_app()
```


```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="98%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/app/www/mainPage.png")
```
  
  
# App description

The `dataCompare` app has three tabs to provide the insight :  
  - Load data  
  - Comparison description
  - Details on difference  

## Load data  

This tab allows user to load data and run the comparison of loaded data.  

**INPUTS** : Upload inputs help to load data in the app. The extensions accepted here are : .csv, .tsv and .rds  
For .csv files, make sure to specify the right seperator `(';', ',', ':')`.  
  
After the user load the data, he can heat on  **`>COMPARE`** button to run the comparison.
The value box bellow the input box will shows the percentage of difference and will be colored according to the value.  

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/app/www/dataLoader.png")
```


**OUTPUTS** : A high level description of data loaded through the uploader. Here, user may find :
variables names, variables types, the complete rate, the distribution or the number of unique values. 
  
  

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="98%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/app/www/afterClickCompare.png")
```


## Comparison description  

This tab allows user to read the first results of the comparison.  
**OUTPUTS** : several tables are displayed here :  
-> table of input data dimension, which shows the number of rows and columns of data to compare  
-> table of comparison summary, which shows values of comparison indicator  
-> table of number of difference by variable, which shows the number of difference by variables in data  
-> table of variables not compared, which shows the variables of each input data which are not compare to others.  
  

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="98%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/app/www/comparisonDescription.png")
```

## Details on difference  

This tab allows user to read the differences between input data cell by cell.  
**OUTPUTS** : several tables are displayed here :  
-> table of attributes, which shows non identical attributes between the two data  
-> table of not shared variables, which shows variables in X but not in Y and present in Y but not in X  
-> table of not shared observations, which shows the observations not shared between the two data  
-> table of detected differences, which shows all the differences in the data row by row.   
  

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="98%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/app/www/detailsDifferences.png")
```
